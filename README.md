## Project Overview

A model of computation is a theoretical framework that abstracts the essential features of a computing system, allowing us to analyze and compare different algorithms and machines based on their computational power and efficiency. In computer science, models of computation are used to study the limits and possibilities of computation, and to explore the relationships between different computational problems and their solutions. By formalizing the notion of computation, models of computation have become essential tools for theoretical computer scientists, algorithm designers, and anyone interested in understanding the nature and scope of computation.

This repos implements RALD-LARD machine, a new model of computation inspired from cyclic tag system and unary numeral system.

## Installation

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.0 or above)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the project repository by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```

cd raldlard
```

### Step 2: Set up a virtual environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Run the following commands:

```
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate # For Unix/Linux
myenv\Scripts\activate # For Windows
```
